# 3D Modeling Portfolio

A collection of 3D modeling and animation projects created with Blender. Each project focuses on a specific concept, technique, or visual style—including animation, stylized rendering, looping loaders, and more.[web:16][web:58]

## Projects

- **keypad**: Keypad animation with mechanical motion.
- **load-screen**: Looping loader designed for UI or game screens.
- **ramen-bowl**: Stylized food model and render.
- **signal**: Rhythmic, abstract signal animation.

Each folder contains:
- A rendered preview image or animation (JPG/GIF/MP4)
- A short `README.md` describing the concept, tools, and focus for the project[web:7][web:59]
